# Asteroids...ish

Fun little project built while working through the Asteroids OOP course on boot.dev. It's just a rough beta-quality demo with some of the game's basic functionality:
* You can move your ship around and turn / shoot
* Asteroids will spawn at 3 different sizes, with the larger 2 properly spawning the smaller sizes when shot, and the small ones being destroyed
* You will crash and burn if an asteroid touches your ship

Missing features (maybe I'll build them eventually):
* Ship movement inertia
* Lives / score system
* Proper game graphics (the course used circles for everything, including the ship's hit~box~circle
* Sounds
* Explosion animations for the ship and asteroids
* UFOs and their associated mechanics
